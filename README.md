# 6Route
6Route is an efficient IPv6 topology discovery framework based on prefix prediction. This framework operates on GNU/Linux. Through traceroute, 6Route can discovers router interfaces and the links between them. 6Route consists of two modules, with the target generation module written in Python and the traceroute module written in Go.
## Building 6Route
To run 6Route, you need to first configure Go environment. Then, 6Route can be compiled by running:

`go build`
## Using 6Route
### Target Generation
Firstly, take the IPv6 prefixes and addresses collected from public data sources as input, and run the Python script target_gene.py. The parameter --address_file represents the IPv6 address file, --prefix_file represents the IPv6 address prefix file, --target_file represents the generated IPv6 target address file, and --budget represents the number of IPv6 target addresses to generate.

`python target_gene.py --address_file address.txt --prefix_file prefix.txt --target_file --budget 10000000`
### Traceroute
Then, run the Go program 6Route to perform traceroute on the target addresses. The parameter --target_file represents the IPv6 target address file generated by target_gene.py, -s represents the source IPv6 address of traceroute, -m represents the MAC address of the source interface, and -r represents the sending rate of probing packets.

`./6Route --target_file target.txt -s source_address -m source_mac -r 10000`
